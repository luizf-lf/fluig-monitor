## About

A desktop application, developed with **Electron**, used to monitor **Fluig** ambients.

The monitoring is done trough the monitoring and statistics **API**, as shown on the [documentation](https://tdn.engpro.totvs.com.br/pages/releaseview.action?pageId=284881802).

This application is being developed for **educational** purposes, with the intention of learning a bit more about `React`, `Electron`, `Typescript`, and the use of Fluig `APIs`.
